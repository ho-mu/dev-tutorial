# Introduction

**Course Structure**

Each day, you will be expected to complete a coding exercise. As you learn a new language \(or most anything\), it takes repetition for concepts to begin to form as standard practices. It is important to not save the exercises until the end of the week.

Each week, you will be expected to complete a coding project. This will be done in teams of x people.. The teams of x will rotate each week so that everyone gets a chance to experience different types of pairing. The expectation is that the pair will work together. You will need to understand how to work with other developers \(as a teacher and a learner\) and practicing this can't be undervalued.

The final project will be the only assignment/work for the final week of the program. This will be completed in teams of xx. Evaluation criteria will be defined and teams will present on the final day of class.



C**ode Editors**

You will need to choose, or perhaps use your favorite code editor. Recommendations with good javascript support:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) \(cross-platform, free\).
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \(cross-platform, free\).
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) \(cross-platform, shareware\).
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) \(Windows, free\).
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.

Most of these editors support prettier.js. Please consider deciding on a formatting style within you teams/groups in order to make changes obvious.

_Choose early if you and your team prefer using semi-colons, 2 or 4 spaces for tabs, etc. and remain consistent._



**git**

Spend some time working with git. If you haven't used git before, please create an account in github and read up on how git works:

Your group/team is expected to commit early and often in order to see progression in your development. Your group will also be expected to choose a branching strategy and explain the pros and cons of the strategy.



**The Basics**

If you don't have prior experience, refresh or look online for a basic introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript to complete prior to starting this course. There will not be any time spent on HTML and CSS during this course but a basic understanding will be used as working in ReactJS will require.



**Terminal / Command Line**

If you have never used the terminal/command line, familiarize yourself with some basic commands.
