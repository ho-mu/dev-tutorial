# \(DUE: 10/xx/2020\) : Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

* the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it \(1+1\),
* the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it \(1+2\),
* the 5 is \(2+3\),
* and so on!
